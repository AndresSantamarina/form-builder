# 🧩 FormBuilder

FormBuilder is a web application that allows users to visually create custom forms by dragging and dropping different types of fields, such as text inputs, checkboxes, and more. You can also preview the form, edit the fields, and configure their properties.

## 🚀  Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## ▶️ Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.
